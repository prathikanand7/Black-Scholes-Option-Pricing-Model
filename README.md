# Black-Scholes Pricing Model

This repository provides an interactive Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model dashboard that helps in visualizing option prices under varying conditions. The dashboard is designed to be user-friendly and interactive, allowing users to explore how changes in spot price, volatility, and other parameters influence the value of options.

It allows users to input the purchase prices for the call and put options and visualize the P&L for various spot prices and volatilities in the form of heatmaps. 

Positive P&L will be represented in green, and negative P&L in red, helping you understand the potential outcomes of your option trades.
